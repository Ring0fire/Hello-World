Truffle-Trot- Endless Runner
This is Truffle Trot, the story of the ambitions of a piglet who is on a quest to retrieve her truffles. 
The only problem I've been having is this project was designed in Unity 5.6.5f1, so many of the components or scripts might not work unless you downgrade to this version of Unity.

Project Goals
-replace current sprites with V2 designs, possibly final designs
-add power ups
-streamline gameplay
-add in-game store that will keep track of players score/spending/upgrades
-update project for most current verion of Unity
-bug resolution as needed
